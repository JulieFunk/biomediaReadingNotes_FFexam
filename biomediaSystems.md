# Biomedia and Systems Theory Notes Log

## Thacker, Eugene. *Biomedia.* Minnesota UP, 2004.

*"Whether it be the use of biological data in protein prediction [bioinformatics]...or the use of biological function for non-biological purposes [biocomputing], ..the emphasis is less on 'technology' as a tool, and more on the technical reconditioning of the 'biological.' It is this assumption, and the twofold logic that extends from it, that characterizes the concept of 'biomedia.' **Put briefly, 'biomedia' is an instance in which biological components and processes are technically recontextualized in ways that may be biological or nonbiological.** Biomedia are novel configurations of biologies and technologies that take us beyond th familiar tropes of technology-as-tool or the human-machine interface"* (pp. 5-6).

*"**The biological and the digital domains are no longer rendered ontologically distinct**, but instead are seen to inhere in each other; the biological 'informs' the digital, just as the digital 'corporealizes' the biological"* (p. 7).

*"...biomedia is based on a particular type of organization...it is not based on the technical metaphor of the 'interface,' in which parts identified according the substance are combined into some hybrid or cyborg-like form...the biological body never stops being biological..; it is precisely for that reason that the biological body is inextricably 'technological'"* (p. 14).


Thacker provides numerous, almost manifesto-like, definitions of what biomedia are (and are not). He tells us that biomedia are not hybridizations of the biological and the digital of cyborg-like transhumanist and extropian ideals. The biological body, which is not necessarily a human body, is already technological as a biological system. It can be encoded, recoded, and decoded. Thacker's definitions of biomedia are general enough that they do not necessarily refer to a mediation or encoding of the biological to the digital, or vice-versa. Nor, does biomedia refer distinctly to genomics and an understanding of DNA as "code." **This makes biomedia an appropriate organization of endocrinological (and exo!) phenomenology encoded and affected through various mediations. However, Thacker's examples inevitably return to bioinformatics and genomics.

*"There is, in biomedia,  a general devaluation of material substrates (the materiality of the medium) as being constitutive of patterns of relationships (or essential data). Although biomedia do take into account the role of material substrates, they exist, as we have seen, in the backdrop, as support for 'what the body can do' (or, more accurately, what patterns of relationships can do)"* (p. 28).

The materiality of the medium is not the essential approach of Thacker's biomedia. That is, Thacker's biomedia does not necessarily render patterns of relationships material, despite them always being biological. This becomes clear in Thacker's discussion of systems biology. I take this to mean that biomedia's focus is on indexing and encoding the biological-as-technical through biomedia as a system. This abstraction does not mean that biomedia are **immaterial**, but that they are organized through symbolic relations (**i.e., patterns of encoding, recoding, decoding**). Biomedia can thus exist in the realm of metaphor, surrealism, and speculation, despite Thacker's focus on extant technologies in genetic bioinformatics.

*"Systems biology has begun by addressing a technical question, but in the process has raised issues that are both technical-scientific and philosophical ethical. The characterization of the biomolecular body as 'inhuman; is not a moral description;* inhuman *does not necessarily imply* antihuman *or* nonethical. *It does, however suggest that a radically 'other' model of the body emerges from the predominantly technical orientations of systems biology, a model we have been calling the biomolecular body"* (p. 163)

*"**Systems theory is a conscious respons to the dominant paradigm of gene centrism in biotech.** In place of the emphasis on genes, it offers an emphasis on interactions between molecules. In place of the emphasis on things, it offers relations. In place of the emphasis on substance, it offers network and pathways of behavior...Howeverm in offering this alternative, it does not take into accound the larger philosphical issues it opens up, namely the incommensurability between the self and the network, between the body and system. **Curiously, it opens onto a nonhuman view of the biomolecular body, one fundamentally at odds with the subject-based, human view of genetic medicine"*** (pp. 173-4)

Again, it seems that Thacker's generalization of biomedia and systems theory is caught up in the specificity of genomic practices, despite his claim that "it offers an emphasis on the interactions between molecules" and not genes. Philosophical questions around genetics have trouble escaping post-Enlightenment ideals of the human as a liberal individual subject. DNA promises an encoding of individuality and there is little room for what might be seen as mutation through input/output (i/o) patterns of interaction with bodies in their environments (open-system Systems Biology). From an epigenetic perspective, unless networking longitudinal systems of genetic "vitality" (a term Thacker already rejects) through inheritance, genetics cannot seem to escape pointing back to the system-as-self. Endo/exocrine relations on the otherhand ooze and leak into their environments. Their encodings, recodings, and decodings occur in patterns of relations through multispecies.
