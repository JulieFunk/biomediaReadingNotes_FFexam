## Berlant, Lauren. “Slow Death: Soverignty, Obesity, Lateral Agency,” *Critical Inquiry*, vol. 33, no. 4, 2007, pp. 754-780.

*"The difference between sovereign agency under a regime of sovereignty and under a regime of biopower, then, can be thought of as a distinction between individual life and collective living on, where living increasingly becomes a scene of the administration, discipline, and recalibration of what constitutes health....Because of these convolutions and variations sovereignty is an inadequate concept for talking about human agency outside of the power of the king’s decree or other boundary acts in proximity to certain performances of law..."* (p. 756)

- Biopower is also the power to make waste into product - see Waldby & Mitchell, Clough "junk DNA"

- Administration, discipline, and recalibration as outsourced to personal technological data managers and visualizers (i.e., wearables). This reaffirms subjugation as it presumes individuals must be responsible for managing their own health under a collective authority that doesn't do the labour of management, but still enforces it

*"But we need better ways to talk about activity oriented toward the reproduction of ordinary life...Indeed, practical sovereignty would be better understood not to take the mimetic or referred shape of state or individual sovereignty but a shape made by mediating conditions of zoning, labor, consumption, and governmentality, as well as unconscious and explicit desires not to be an inflated ego deploying and manifesting power."* (p. 757)

*"Environment denotes a dialectical scene where the interaction reified as structure and agency is manifest in predictable repetitions; an environment is made via spatial practices and can absorb how time ordinarily passes, how forgettable most events are, and, overall, how people’s ordinary perseverations fluctuate in patterns of undramatic attachment and identification"* (pp. 759-760).

- Berlant does not wholesale refuse "sovereignty" but finds it is not capable of capturing its role in "the reproduction of [biopower in] ordinary life". Instead, Berlant points to a practical sovereignty and **lateral agency** which better points to environments of networked agency/causality in which obesity is endemic

- Slow death occurs in envrionments -- See, Ahi-King, Szczygielska, Gowdy's *The White Bone*. Berlant uses "environment" rather than "event" to describe space temporally, understanding that environment is dialectic and vibrant, even volatile.

*"Finally, what does it mean that African Americans and Latino/as are especially bearing this body burden
along with the symbolic negativity long attached to it, so much so that one physician, a member of the Black Women’s Health Network, observes that the “most lethal weapon” against black people in the contemporary U.S. is the fork?"* (p. 765)

*"In the initial justification for action by an administration dedicated to
shrinking the domestic government as a resource for the socially, physically,
or economically disabled, we get images of stressed-out, overworked bodies responding biologically by hoarding even healthy food in the body’s fat stores. This physiology of stress is translated into increasing anxieties about the healthcare costs that businesses have to face."* (p. 768)

*"The explanation from genetic predisposition often attempts to deshame individuals for their body size / mental state and to release them from paralyzing burdens of responsibility for it, to be substituted for by wellintended medicalization."* (p. 771) 

- Individual blame - posits Black women as self-harming  while not acknowledging environmental (qua political) stresses https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.118.005284 

- Hormonal response to labour and political economy! Agency within and around the body

- Ex. of genetics constructing the subject rather than acknowledging that obesity and other health epidemics are actually endemic of networked, environmental failures to support lateral agency - not sovereignty over bodies that are determined simply by flesh borders

## Clough, Patricia T. "The Affective Turn Political Economy, Biomedia and Bodies," *Theory, Culture & Society*, vol. 25, no. 1, 2008, pp. 1-22

*"However, the turn to affect did propose a substantive shift in that it returned critical theory and cultural criticism to bodily matter which had been treated in terms of various constructionisms under the influence of post-structuralism and deconstruction. The turn to affect points instead to a dynamism immanent to bodily matter and matter generally – matter’s capacity for self-organization in being in-formational – which, I want to argue, may be the most provocative and enduring contribution of the affective turn."* (p. 1)

*"I want to argue that focusing on affect – without following the circuit from affect to subjectively felt emotional states – makes clear how the turn to affect is a harbinger of and a discursive accompaniment to the forging of a new body, what I am calling the biomediated body."* (p. 2)

- We can look as bodily matter's capacity for self-organization,  *CO*-organization, and in being in-formational without the politics of subject-making since the turn to affect moved away from the ideological concerns of post-structuralism and deconstruction. See Waldby and Mitchell re: how the biomedical-legal system creates subjects through property rights and a bioethics based on "dignity."

*"...the historically specific mode of organization of material forces that the biomediated body is, both in relationship to what I will discuss as capital accumulation in the domain of affect and the accompanying relations of power in the shift of governance from discipline to biopolitical control, a shift that depends on a certain deployment of racism."* (pp. 2-3)

*"The affective capacity of bodies, statistically simulated as risk factors, **can be apprehended as such without the subject, even without the individual subject’s body,** bringing forth competing bureaucratic procedures of control and political command in terms of securing the life of populations."* (p. 18, emphasis added)

- Clough turns to Foucault's definition of racism as a biopolitical effect strategy later in this article. An example of such would be Canada's current use of forced sterilization of Indigenous women. Biopolitical control **does not require a subject body**.

*"But if this reference to autonomic responses seems to make affect the equivalent of the empirical measure of bodily effects, registered in activity such as dilation of pupils, constriction of intestinal peristalsis, gland secretion, galvanic skin responses, Massumi goes on to use such measures for a philosophical escape to think affect in terms of the virtual as the realm of potential, unliveable as tendencies or incipient acts, indeterminant and emergent."* (p. 3)

*"I would argue, the affectivity of matter, matter’s capacity for self-organization, its being informational. It is this understanding of matter as affective, as informational and self-organizing, that connects the autonomic responses of the body, or what Massumi calls the ‘infraempirical’ experience of the human body, to the incorporeal, nonphenomenal complexity that is the condition of possibility of the empirical, what Massumi calls the ‘superempirical’(2002, 144–61 passim). Just
as the virtual falls away with each actualization, which, at the moment of actualization, limits the virtual field, the super-empirical falls away with the emergence of the empirical."* (p. 4)

*"As Hansen puts it: ‘When the body acts to **enframe** digital information . . . what it frames is in effect itself: its own affectively experienced sensation of coming into contact with the digital’"* (p. 8, emphasis added) 

*"The biomediated body, therefore, is not disembodiment. Rather it is a recent complexification in bodily matter at the molecular level as its informational
capacity is made more productive [via technological framing/technicity]...In the technological framing of the ‘labor performed routinely by cells, proteins, and
DNA’, biomedia produces the biomediated body as a laboring body"* (p. 10)

- Empirically, the endocrine system is inherently linked to the virtual - though indeterminate, it responds to affect and is biomediated by it. The superempirical (virtual) is lost when the endocrine system is made emprical/quantifiable - Think through this re: biometrics, Mira, Wearable Lab, etc. Labouring bodies of cells needs to be addressed re: *Tissue Economies*

- Waste tissues are biomediated outside of flesh bodies - bodies change shape and composition. Bodies become technical - Is a lab a body? See Wearable Lab and Laboratory Life

*"Biomedia, rather, is the infrastructure of a political economy which aims to continually transform informatic-based products, into ‘the long-term generation of information’ (Thacker, 2005: 80)."* (p. 10)

- In this way bodies as informatic-based matter are made commoditity - but can biomedia resist political economy? --> Tsang, Mol (sort of)

## Waldby, Catherine and Robert Mitchell. *Tissue Economies: Blood, Organs, and Cell Lines in Late Capitalism*, 2006.

*"Previous commentators have noted, but only in a cursory way, that the majority in the state supreme court discussed at some length the similarities between Moore's cells and human feces...This discourse focused on* valuable *human tissues, such as blood and organs, and linked the dissemination of these tissues to the smooth flow of information between management facilities (for example, hospitals and blood blanks); the absence of such information flows was purported to produce tissue waste in the form of expired blood and degraded organs"* (p. 90).

- In Moore's case, California's supreme court found that individuals held no property rights to the excised diseased tissue (i.e., "waste") used to create and commercialize infinite cell lines. However, this grants intellectual rights and property rights only to those who *have the ability* to turn "waste" tissue into something with use value and thereby, under neoliberal organization of medical systems, exchange value (commodity). The court's findings did not account for the labour of the patient in their production and housing of the tissues before surgical excision. I suggest that these patients are co-producers of these scientific findings and should be granted co-authorship on medical patents and papers. 

- I extend this concern to tissues taken from plants and animals. Here, the courts' judgements on "dignity" are no longer useful (see Wolfe). The question of dignity does not sufficiently get at the issue of labour. Instead, questions of sovereignty and sustainablity should inform tissue collection of all living organisms where "sovereignty" recognizes the organism's vitality and its role as labourer and co-producer. When collections transformations of living tissue are informed by the sovereignty of the organism from which the tissue was originally  produced, "dignity" should be a foregone conclusion.

*"In support of this claim [police do not have the right to seizure of feces] the Maryland Court of Appeals had concluded that just as people often assert 'ownership, dominion, or control' over body parts such as 'hair, fingernails, toenails, blood and organs,' so too ought one be able to exert these powers over 'excrememnt, fluid waste, [and] secretions...The court noted that human waste such as feces lacked the 'dignity of the human cell'...The court [Moore v. Cal] noted that human waste such as feces lacked the 'dignity of the human cell'"* (p. 93).

As neoliberalism is concerned with the ownership of matter by an individual or corporate entity, subjectivity is determined by property rights and intellectual rights. This is an erasure of the labour power needed to produce the cells in the first place -- the literal metabolism and conversion of energy by cells. Like my argument with "dignity," concerns of ownership cannot properly account for the networked labour involved in creating cells - both diseased cells and clinically "healthy" ones. That is, even those tissues considered "waste" tissues are co-produced. The very nature of 'excrememnt, fluid waste, [and] secretions' is that they are networked and co-produced beyond the flesh borders of the body. **See Clough (p. 10) for more on tissues as labouring bodies**

*"Frow (1997), in his careful reading of Mauss, notes that in this traditional system of obligatory giving, recieving, and reciprocation, gifts act more like loans. They both **create and mediate** relationships between persons and continue to refer to the original owner, irrespective of circulation"* (p. 15, emphasis added)

- While Frow does point to ownership as a single referent and locus to tissue, the framing of tissue transfer as creation and mediation should be expanded beyond subject and ownership. As Frow points out, these tissues are agental and networked between persons, thus they their referents are multiple and as they create and mediate relationships between persons, these persons (regardless of legal "ownership" at any given time) are also creating and mediating the tissue.

*"This complicates considerably the relationship between national tissue economies and the globalization of tissue flows, as the pension funds designed to safeguard the welfare of an aging national body politc have effectively become the means for further disentangling particular tissues and samples from their national origins"* (p. 183)
