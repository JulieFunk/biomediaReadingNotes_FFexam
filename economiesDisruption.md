# Economies of Hormonal Disruption Log
**Last updated: March 3, 2021**

## Preciado, Paul B. *Testo Junkie: Sex, Drugs, and Biopolitics in the Pharmacopornographic Era*, Trans. Bruce Benderson, Feminist Press, 2013.

*"Only the strict relationship between my body and the substance is a cult object [on Preciado's recording of T administration with masturbation], an object of surveillance. I spread the gel over my shoulders. First instant: the feeling of a light slap on the skin. The feeling changes into one of coldness before it disappears...How can I explain what is happening to me? What can I do about my desire for transformation?"* (p. 21)

In Preciado's ritualistic application of T, **the medium is literally the massage.** Along with hormonal application, Preciado is opening his body to accept possession, hauntologies of the the lives lost to trans violence and alienation. The exchange of chemicals, substances, from outside the body to inside the body is both material and symbolic. Further, the ritual is mediated and remediated through the act of filming and uploading to trans forums and archives on the internet.

*"During the twentieth century, the 'invention' of the biochemical notion of the hormone and the pharmaceutical development of synthetic molecules for commercial uses radically modified traditional definitions of normal and pathological sexual identities." (p. 26)

*"...The invention of the contraceptive pill, the first biochemical technique enabling the seperation between heterosexual practice and reproduction, was a direct result of the expansion of endocrinological experimentation...In 1957, Searle & Co. commercialized Enovid, the first contraceptive pill ("the Pill") made of a combination of mestranol and norethynodrei. First promoted for the treatment of menstrual disorders, the Pill was approved for contraceptive use four years later."* (p. 28)

*"Pharmacopornographic biocapitalism does not produce things. It produces moveable ideas, living organs, symbols, desires, chemical reactions, **and affects.** In the fields of biotechnology and pornocommunication, there are not objects to produce; it's a matter of* inventing *a subject and producing it on the global scale"* (p. 54, emphases added)

*"The real stake of capitalism today is the pharmacopornographic control of subjectivity, whose products are serotonin, techno-blood, and blood products, testosterone, antacids, cortisone, techno-sperm, antibiotics, estradiol, techno-milk, alcohol and tobacco, morphine, insulin, cocaine, living human eggs, citrate of sildenafil (Viagra), and the entire material and virtual complex participating in the production of mental and psychsomatic states of excitation, relaxation, and discharge, as well as those of omnipotenceand total control."* (p, 39)

The pharmacopornographic era mediated bodies through biopolitical economies that both "make" and "cure" disorders. See Mira. This is part of pharmacopornographic biocapitalism's production of subjects. **Perturbations** both (re)produce the pharmacopornographic subject but can also radically reimagine these power structures through (re)distribution and disruption of the biopolitical economy of discharge, secretions, and leaks. *"[Technoscience as a material-discursive authority is] manifest in the commercial chemical substances and molecules, biotype bodies, and **fungible technological goods** managed by multinationals."* (p. 34)

*"[Safety Instructions for Users of TESTOGEL 50 mg, gel in sachets] Possible transference of testosterone. Failing to follow recommended safety instructions may cause the transfer of testosterone onto another individual during intimate and prolonged cutaneous contact with the area to which the gel has been applied."* (p. 59)

*"In the case of testosterone, controls over the 'passage of the substance' seem more complicated, not only because it is liable to be sold on the black market and consumed without a prescription, but especially because Testogel applied to one body can 'pass' imperceptibly onto another body through skin contact Testosterone is one of the rare [implied illicit] drugs that is spread by sweat, from skin to skin, body to body"* (p. 65)

Hormones are boundary passing and can easily be shared intimately. This cannot be controlled or surveilled in praxis as Preciado mentions in the following paragraph. However, trans visibility *is* very much surveilled as a person "panopticon" as Malatino writes (*Trans Care*, p. 26).




## Malatino, Hil. *Trans Care*, Minnesota UP, 2020.

*"The boundaries between who is a carer and who is a recipient of care are pretty radically blurred in [t4t 'voluntary gender work']...any act of care is simultaneously an act of maintaing those minimal networks of support that sustain you...The language of 'compassion fatigue' or 'vicarious trauma' becomes challenging here. Compassion--the experience of deep sorrow or sympathy for the suffering of an other--is inadequate affective accounting of what transpires when a community or collective is involved in acts of caring and being cared for that are infomred by similar and mutually resonating forms of traumatization."* (p. 24)

Like Mol's account of caring, Malatino bases care in a feminist (though distinctly non-familial and non-domescile, see p. 6) organization of networked care labour. Care, in in this organization, is affective and lively. More so, Malatino is able to help us think through to the way bodies inform and share in the labour of care in hormonally material ways. Spaces of disphoria and dissonance when hormone levels simply aren't at the right potency, frequency, or efficacy for cellular reception in either the carer or the reciepient of care can change the course of what care can be provided at that time, along with who is able to provide care to whom. Matino writes with an awareness of this, particularly in their pondering of what the "news cycle is doing to [their] adrenals." Trans care requires reciprocal hormonal care.

Malatino, like Mol, also writes with a tendency to see care as an act towards "heal[ing]" (p.2) or to be "healthy" (Mol). In these moments both of the authors, = optimistically, approach care as a means to an end in which healing is possible. But total healing or "health" is not always possible, and care is often an ongoing collaborative project amongst many actors over long periods of time. The notion that one could be healed if cared for *enough* or in *the right ways* operates through a neoliberal logic that bodies can be made socially and economically productive if enough labour, in this case care labour, is put into the project of health. For many bodies "healing" or "full health," at least by clincal standards, is simply not possible.

In this way, care is sharing hormones, not just through material exchanges of pharmaceutical treatments (Preciado's Testogel, birth control pills), but literally through bodies that produce affect and emphathy, whose hormonal profiles in these moments can allow a body to both give care and recieve care. This is true ritually and symbolically for Preciado (see *Testo Junkie*, pp. 20, 65).

*"Each day, my social media feed is populated with requests for rent money, for money to keep the power on, fur funds to repair a car, or to fund some other necessary expense that ensures minimal forms of survival. Sometimes, I can throw money at these requests. Sometimes, the most I can do is commiserate in frustrated empathy. Both of these responses are trans care praxis. We turn to social media for support that is simultaneously fiscal and affective, simultaneously practical (for advice about physicians, knowledge about underresearched side effects of exogenous hormones, about what clinics operated on an informed consent model, to seek legal advice) and ephemerally affirmative.."* (p. 66)

Malatino reminds us that in the affective economy, feminist trans care and other forms of feminist care, are also fiscally economic. Not just for medical care, but for general survival in all facets of living.

## Mol, Annemarie. *The Logic of Care: Health and the Problem of Patient Choice*, Routledge, 2008.

*"Are 'we', in the 'West', indeed autonomous individuals? The answer is: no, 'we' are not...Some sociologists have studied how in actual practice people in 'free societies' make their choices. They have found that making choices takes a lot of energy, energy that not everybody has to spare or likes to spend on it. They have also found that 'we' end up choosing remarkably similar things. Indeed some scholars have argued that autonomy is not the opposite of heteronomy at all. Instead, they say, making people long for choices and investing in them is a disciplining technique."* (p. 4)

*"The West is not simply Enlightened. It does not just celebrate rationality, autonomy and choice, but has a rich and multi-layered care tradition as well."* (p. 5)

*"The scientific tradition that is currently most prominent in health care--that of clinical epidemiology--has not been designed to deal with the unexpected effects of interventions."* (p. 99)

- Mol starts her critique by pressuring the 'Western' tradition of certain Enlightenment ideals which favour traits like rationality, autonomy of the person, and choice. However, these values, as Mol argues, are not the sole ideals espoused in Enlightenment philosophy and there has been an erasure of traditions of care in classical liberalism. Not only does the fixing of certain ideals in time and politic make for ideaological thinking, this also becomes problematic for Mol as the medical sciences have based their practices on many of these fixed Enlightenment ideals in their methodolofy which makes medical philosophy ill-suited to face the unexpected and turbulant nature of patient life that comes into play in clinical practice. This is why Mol suggests a 'logic of care' is necessary in (specifically diabetes) clinical treatment.

- Mol looks presents two competing logics, the 'logic of care' and the 'logic of choice' present in her ethnographic accounts of diabetes treatment and management in on hospital's outpatient clinic in the Netherlands. For Mol, the logic of choice, while an ethical step of from medical paternalism (often seen as forced treatment plans/no options), often ends up rejecting patients lived experiences in its two manifestations: a consumerist logic of choice which centres patient-as-customer, and thereby sells treatment as products without the dialogic process of care, and a civic logic of choice that centres patient-as-citizen which figures the patients' rational accounts of their experiences as removed from the body which can prove counterproductive to treating diseases of the body ("...citizens have to control, tame or transcend their bodies so as to be able to choose" (p. 47))

- Instead, the logic of care is a process (p. 20) which requires open and active dialogue from both doctor and patient, as well as mutual responsibility and expertise (the patient is the expert of their own lives/experiences). The care process is unstable, complex and sometimes unweildy, it "involves a team (of professionals, machines, medication, **bodies**, patients, and relevant others) and tasks are divided between members of that team in ever-changing ways" (p. 21, emphasis my own). While Mol's 'logic of care' often privileges the discourse of *embodiment* and *lived experience*, it is interesting that she often highlights the "body" as something seperate from disease or the patient themselves. In this way, Mol subscribes to the Cartesian language of mind/body split which undermines the logic of care's networked approach to living with chronic illness. 

- Further, Mol claims her work is in "unravelling" of languages, styles and genres (p. 91). However, as a critical discourse analysis Mol in fact does not deeply interrogate language in the cultural world of clinical diabetes treatment. Rather, she employs loose and floating terminology such as "health" and "healthy" to signify good care without critically addressing the vacuous social baggage behind what it means to be "healthy."

*"Yes, this is exactly what the logic of care wants you to do. In order to take care of yourself, you may need to deviate."

- The logic of care embraces compassionate deviancy over rigid 'normalcy.'

*"[The patient's] diabetes nurse explained how to use a monitor a long time ago. But even so, there is something more troubling about presenting a blood sugar monitor as a separate sellable product, disentangled from the care process in which it is embedded...The market requires that some product (device, plus skills training, plus kindness and attention) is delineated as the product on offer. A lot may be included in this product, but what is on offer and what is not has to be specified." (p. 20)

*"Whichever the form of diabetes, the care process supplements the failing internal feedback system with one which is partially external." (p. 21)

*"When you have injected insulin, blood sugar levels decrease as the cells burn up or stock the sugar they can now absorb. As blood sugar levels get lower, **bodies** without diabetes start to produce glucagon which releases the body's sugar supplies. In **people** with diabetes, this counter-regulation does not work properly." (p. 50)*

- In the logic of care, learning how to *care for a product* (i.e., proper usage of technology) is part of learning how to *care for a patient*. The product offered must include support to care for the material/commercial elements of the treatment. The patient and the technology are collectively networked in this way. Per Mol's description, the condition of diabetes requires *conscious externalization* of endocrinological feedback system - making it almost exocrine.

- From Berlant's "A Slow Death": "Antidepression and antiobesity initiatives both seek to orchestrate a translocal, collective environment for personal social change, involving families, friends, teachers, colleagues, and medical professionals" (pp. 769-770).

*"Technologies in treatments are taken to be 'means'. They serve an end...Countering a simplified belief in 'science' as the answer to all questions, the logic of choice stresses the multiplicity of medical possiblities. This makes good sense. In its turn, however, the logic of choice simplifies the relation between means and end. It suggests that, if you choose where you want to go, your technologies will get you there, However, in the consulting room, it quickly becomes clear that technologies are not obedient means: they rarely subordinate themselves to their official ends." (pp. 54-55)*

- In her critique of oversimplifying science and technology as a 'means to end' in the logic of choice, Mol perhaps adopts a Heideggerian view of medical ontology. Here, the logic of choice sees patient and their tools not as integrated prosthetics in a network of activity, but as isolated objects that are 'present-at-hand.' In the logic of care, the technologies are integrated into all aspects of the life, sociality, history, etc., of the patient and fit into a ready-to-hand ontology of diabetes treatment. In fact, it may be that it is not until the logic-of-choice's 'present-at-hand' ontology fails (eg., blood glucose monitors are too bulky, the buttons are too small, test strips for that brand are too expensive/not covered by a patient's insurance), that the technology is then characterized by its 'unreadiness-to-hand.'


## Berlant, Lauren. “Slow Death: Soverignty, Obesity, Lateral Agency,” *Critical Inquiry*, vol. 33, no. 4, 2007, pp. 754-780.

*"The difference between sovereign agency under a regime of sovereignty and under a regime of biopower, then, can be thought of as a distinction between individual life and collective living on, where living increasingly becomes a scene of the administration, discipline, and recalibration of what constitutes health....Because of these convolutions and variations sovereignty is an inadequate concept for talking about human agency outside of the power of the king’s decree or other boundary acts in proximity to certain performances of law..."* (p. 756)

- Biopower is also the power to make waste into product - see Waldby & Mitchell, Clough "junk DNA"

- Administration, discipline, and recalibration as outsourced to personal technological data managers and visualizers (i.e., wearables). This reaffirms subjugation as it presumes individuals must be responsible for managing their own health under a collective authority that doesn't do the labour of management, but still enforces it

*"But we need better ways to talk about activity oriented toward the reproduction of ordinary life...Indeed, practical sovereignty would be better understood not to take the mimetic or referred shape of state or individual sovereignty but a shape made by mediating conditions of zoning, labor, consumption, and governmentality, as well as unconscious and explicit desires not to be an inflated ego deploying and manifesting power."* (p. 757)

*"Environment denotes a dialectical scene where the interaction reified as structure and agency is manifest in predictable repetitions; an environment is made via spatial practices and can absorb how time ordinarily passes, how forgettable most events are, and, overall, how people’s ordinary perseverations fluctuate in patterns of undramatic attachment and identification"* (pp. 759-760).

- Berlant does not wholesale refuse "sovereignty" but finds it is not capable of capturing its role in "the reproduction of [biopower in] ordinary life". Instead, Berlant points to a practical sovereignty and **lateral agency** which better points to environments of networked agency/causality in which obesity is endemic

- Slow death occurs in envrionments -- See, Ahi-King, Szczygielska, Gowdy's *The White Bone*. Berlant uses "environment" rather than "event" to describe space temporally, understanding that environment is dialectic and vibrant, even volatile.

*"In short, everyday more and more advice circulates about how better to get the fat (the substance and the people) under control"* (p. 763)

*"In the initial justification for action by an administration dedicated to shrinking the domestic government as a resource for the socially, physically, or economically disabled, we get images of stressed-out, overworked bodies responding biologically by hoarding even healthy food in the body’s fat stores. This physiology of stress is translated into increasing anxieties about the healthcare costs that businesses have to face."* (p. 768)

- Metabolic control, insulin, leptin, and oestrogen. To control the composition of the people-as-system is to control the management of mediating chemical processes - to attempt to mediate differently, more *efficiently*

- Hormonal response to labour and political economy! Agency within and around the body

*"Finally, what does it mean that African Americans and Latino/as are especially bearing this body burden
along with the symbolic negativity long attached to it, so much so that one physician, a member of the Black Women’s Health Network, observes that the “most lethal weapon” against black people in the contemporary U.S. is the fork?"* (p. 765)

*"The explanation from genetic predisposition often attempts to deshame individuals for their body size / mental state and to release them from paralyzing burdens of responsibility for it, to be substituted for by wellintended medicalization."* (p. 771) 

- Individual blame - posits Black women as self-harming  while not acknowledging environmental (qua political) stresses https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.118.005284 

- Ex. of genetics constructing the subject rather than acknowledging that obesity and other health epidemics are actually endemic of networked, environmental failures to support lateral agency - not sovereignty over bodies that are determined simply by flesh borders

## Clough, Patricia T. "The Affective Turn Political Economy, Biomedia and Bodies," *Theory, Culture & Society*, vol. 25, no. 1, 2008, pp. 1-22

*"However, the turn to affect did propose a substantive shift in that it returned critical theory and cultural criticism to bodily matter which had been treated in terms of various constructionisms under the influence of post-structuralism and deconstruction. The turn to affect points instead to a dynamism immanent to bodily matter and matter generally – matter’s capacity for self-organization in being in-formational – which, I want to argue, may be the most provocative and enduring contribution of the affective turn."* (p. 1)

*"I want to argue that focusing on affect – without following the circuit from affect to subjectively felt emotional states – makes clear how the turn to affect is a harbinger of and a discursive accompaniment to the forging of a new body, what I am calling the biomediated body."* (p. 2)

- We can look as bodily matter's capacity for self-organization,  *CO*-organization, and in being in-formational without the politics of subject-making since the turn to affect moved away from the ideological concerns of post-structuralism and deconstruction. See Waldby and Mitchell re: how the biomedical-legal system creates subjects through property rights and a bioethics based on "dignity."

*"...the historically specific mode of organization of material forces that the biomediated body is, both in relationship to what I will discuss as capital accumulation in the domain of affect and the accompanying relations of power in the shift of governance from discipline to biopolitical control, a shift that depends on a certain deployment of racism."* (pp. 2-3)

*"The affective capacity of bodies, statistically simulated as risk factors, **can be apprehended as such without the subject, even without the individual subject’s body,** bringing forth competing bureaucratic procedures of control and political command in terms of securing the life of populations."* (p. 18, emphasis added)

- Clough turns to Foucault's definition of racism as a biopolitical effect strategy later in this article. An example of such would be Canada's current use of forced sterilization of Indigenous women. Biopolitical control **does not require a subject body**.

*"But if this reference to autonomic responses seems to make affect the equivalent of the empirical measure of bodily effects, registered in activity such as dilation of pupils, constriction of intestinal peristalsis, gland secretion, galvanic skin responses, Massumi goes on to use such measures for a philosophical escape to think affect in terms of the virtual as the realm of potential, unliveable as tendencies or incipient acts, indeterminant and emergent."* (p. 3)

*"I would argue, the affectivity of matter, matter’s capacity for self-organization, its being informational. It is this understanding of matter as affective, as informational and self-organizing, that connects the autonomic responses of the body, or what Massumi calls the ‘infraempirical’ experience of the human body, to the incorporeal, nonphenomenal complexity that is the condition of possibility of the empirical, what Massumi calls the ‘superempirical’(2002, 144–61 passim). Just
as the virtual falls away with each actualization, which, at the moment of actualization, limits the virtual field, the super-empirical falls away with the emergence of the empirical."* (p. 4)

*"As Hansen puts it: ‘When the body acts to **enframe** digital information . . . what it frames is in effect itself: its own affectively experienced sensation of coming into contact with the digital’"* (p. 8, emphasis added) 

*"The biomediated body, therefore, is not disembodiment. Rather it is a recent complexification in bodily matter at the molecular level as its informational
capacity is made more productive [via technological framing/technicity]...In the technological framing of the ‘labor performed routinely by cells, proteins, and
DNA’, biomedia produces the biomediated body as a laboring body"* (p. 10)

- Empirically, the endocrine system is inherently linked to the virtual - though indeterminate, it responds to affect and is biomediated by it. The superempirical (virtual) is lost when the endocrine system is made emprical/quantifiable - Think through this re: biometrics, Mira, Wearable Lab, etc. Labouring bodies of cells needs to be addressed re: *Tissue Economies*

- Waste tissues are biomediated outside of flesh bodies - bodies change shape and composition. Bodies become technical - Is a lab a body? See Wearable Lab and Laboratory Life

*"Biomedia, rather, is the infrastructure of a political economy which aims to continually transform informatic-based products, into ‘the long-term generation of information’ (Thacker, 2005: 80)."* (p. 10)

- In this way bodies as informatic-based matter are made commoditity - but can biomedia resist political economy? --> Tsang, Mol (sort of)

## Waldby, Catherine and Robert Mitchell. *Tissue Economies: Blood, Organs, and Cell Lines in Late Capitalism*, 2006.

*"Previous commentators have noted, but only in a cursory way, that the majority in the state supreme court discussed at some length the similarities between Moore's cells and human feces...This discourse focused on* valuable *human tissues, such as blood and organs, and linked the dissemination of these tissues to the smooth flow of information between management facilities (for example, hospitals and blood blanks); the absence of such information flows was purported to produce tissue waste in the form of expired blood and degraded organs"* (p. 90).

- In Moore's case, California's supreme court found that individuals held no property rights to the excised diseased tissue (i.e., "waste") used to create and commercialize infinite cell lines. However, this grants intellectual rights and property rights only to those who *have the ability* to turn "waste" tissue into something with use value and thereby, under neoliberal organization of medical systems, exchange value (commodity). The court's findings did not account for the labour of the patient in their production and housing of the tissues before surgical excision. I suggest that these patients are co-producers of these scientific findings and should be granted co-authorship on medical patents and papers. 

- I extend this concern to tissues taken from plants and animals. Here, the courts' judgements on "dignity" are no longer useful (see Wolfe). The question of dignity does not sufficiently get at the issue of labour. Instead, questions of sovereignty and sustainablity should inform tissue collection of all living organisms where "sovereignty" recognizes the organism's vitality and its role as labourer and co-producer. When collections transformations of living tissue are informed by the sovereignty of the organism from which the tissue was originally  produced, "dignity" should be a foregone conclusion.

*"In support of this claim [police do not have the right to seizure of feces] the Maryland Court of Appeals had concluded that just as people often assert 'ownership, dominion, or control' over body parts such as 'hair, fingernails, toenails, blood and organs,' so too ought one be able to exert these powers over 'excrememnt, fluid waste, [and] secretions...The court noted that human waste such as feces lacked the 'dignity of the human cell'...The court [Moore v. Cal] noted that human waste such as feces lacked the 'dignity of the human cell'"* (p. 93).

As neoliberalism is concerned with the ownership of matter by an individual or corporate entity, subjectivity is determined by property rights and intellectual rights. This is an erasure of the labour power needed to produce the cells in the first place -- the literal metabolism and conversion of energy by cells. Like my argument with "dignity," concerns of ownership cannot properly account for the networked labour involved in creating cells - both diseased cells and clinically "healthy" ones. That is, even those tissues considered "waste" tissues are co-produced. The very nature of 'excrememnt, fluid waste, [and] secretions' is that they are networked and co-produced beyond the flesh borders of the body. **See Clough (p. 10) for more on tissues as labouring bodies**

*"Frow (1997), in his careful reading of Mauss, notes that in this traditional system of obligatory giving, recieving, and reciprocation, gifts act more like loans. They both **create and mediate** relationships between persons and continue to refer to the original owner, irrespective of circulation"* (p. 15, emphasis added)

- While Frow does point to ownership as a single referent and locus to tissue, the framing of tissue transfer as creation and mediation should be expanded beyond subject and ownership. As Frow points out, these tissues are agental and networked between persons, thus they their referents are multiple and as they create and mediate relationships between persons, these persons (regardless of legal "ownership" at any given time) are also creating and mediating the tissue.

*"This complicates considerably the relationship between national tissue economies and the globalization of tissue flows, as the pension funds designed to safeguard the welfare of an aging national body politc have effectively become the means for further disentangling particular tissues and samples from their national origins"* (p. 183)

- borderless tissues
