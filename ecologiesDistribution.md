# Ecologies of Hormonal Distribution Log
**Last updated March 25, 2021**

## Murphy, Michelle. “What Can’t a Body Do?” Catalyst, Vol. 1, No. 3, Critical Commentary, 2017, pp. 1-15.

*"I can say all this with the help of a motley array of disciplines – metabolomics, toxicology, biomonitoring, epigenomics, and so on – each of which offers an **instrument-mediated** micrological glimpse into the vastness of our chemical relations"* (emphasis added, p. 2).

*"Sometimes chemical exposures are sensible, but mostly they are not, so we are often guessing that we sense them, retroactively, in the symptom, the brain fog, the miscarriage, the worry, the lump, the grief that comes later. Chemical relations connect us backwards in time, but also forward into what our bodies will become, into the future environment that we are cumulatively assembling"* (p. 2).

- The affect of biochemical distribution is not immediately sensible (instrumentally mediated) to most people, but eventually the effects (symptoms) are.

*"At the material metabolic and chemical level, embodiment is already altered, already non-innocently embroiled in uneven violent relations of being and doing"* (p. 4).

*"It is in this bundle of tension that we might fashion a politics of decolonial STS both with and against 'the body'...Moreover, **“the body” itself is in need of dismantling**..."* (pp. 4-5).

- We are all already implicated. All hormones are reproductive and that includes a potential to reproduce violence/disability.

- The human body, the flesh body, is not a universal site. We need to expand to bodies past the flesh body. All endo is exo.

*"We might, I suggest, call this alter-embodiment alterlife — a state of already having been altered by environmental violence that is nonetheless a capacity to become something else"* (p. 5).

*"Attention to alterlife asks, not for a politics of fixing the other..."* (p. 8).

- 'Afterlife' as an alternate theory of embodiment also plays off of the biochemical/pharmacokinetic half lives of active chemicals.

- Not individualized solutions applied universally -- this is the part of Afterlife that builds on response-ability.

*"Or put more simply: how do particular practices materialize particular modes of being? How does doing materialize being?"* (p. 7).

- Being is already materialized, so is practice. Perhaps more specifically the question is:
In which ways do practices and methodologies (what are the differences?) organize "materialized being?"

*"Eve Tuck (Tuck, 2009) who has called for 'suspending damage' as a refusal to participate in 'damage based research' that concentrates the scope of attention on the dissection of bodies and biologies that are then reductively constituted as pathological and devalued. Invasive organisms are to be removed, bird damaged in oil spills culled, disturbed land becomes a **terra nullius**"* (p. 9).

- Waste lands -- these become lands occupied with what the anthropocentric ontoepistemological view of biology considers waste. See *Tissue Economies.*


## Parikka, Jussi. “Animal Ensembles, Robotic Affects” Insect Media: An Archealogy of Animals and Technology, Minnesota UP, 2010, pp. 121-144.

*"John Johnston offers...a rethinking of the various complex ties among actual machinery such as computers, information and control sciences, and the refashioning of living systems as information entities instead of heat engines. The coinvestigation into computing and how life is fundamentally concieved of and defined by 'the regulation of passage of information,..."* (pp. 121-122).

*"Physiology fed into design of computer systems that **remediated** organs and memory as if in the human 'system'...As Hayles notes, Warren McCulloch was continuously interested in the importance of embodiment for calculations. The drive was toward seeing how human beings and computers could share a similar ontological background in flows of binary code"* (emphasis added, p. 122)

*"According to Sismondon, 'The living being...is a system within a system, containing* within *itself* a mediation...' The body of the living being is thus an intensive carrier of change, which resonates with its environment"* (p. 142).

- Popular endocrinology / pop hormones use mediation as a metaphor for process/function. This makes sense as endocrinology is a distinctly modern, even cybernetic (developing concurrently), science. I think this metaphor of mediation is useful for thinking through and talking about hormones and their affective power, but it needs to be extended to economies and ecologies.

- Early cybernetic thinkers have explored embodiment and interaction beyond the material confines of the flesh or hardware. This is why there is a need for affect theory in exploring biomediated experience. Seeing both bodies and computers as systems of "evironmental referentiality" (p. 129) helps us employ affect theory.

*"In his critique of hylomorphic notions of form and content, Sismondon challenges the formalist ideas of information theories. Information is too often seen through conceptual dualisms of form and content., which brands communication as the stable process of transmitting content already in place. For example, the idea of bee communication is too easily formalized as a functionalist account of transmitting abstract symbols about the world **rather than as an active part of individuation**...[Information] assembles agencies into positions in a parallel move as language shifts from a represenatational signification to a gathering of terms of relations, collectives, and **transindividuals**--a project of connection"* (p. 141).

*"Individuation does not measure information, but information points to an orientation with it. All of this happens in the intensive environmental relation in which any 'senders' and 'receivers' are enveloped in the individuation taking place. To specify this point in terms of communication research, we are dealing with information as an arrangement and creative relations between different states of reality."* (pp. 143-144).

- This dualism occurs in endo/exocrinology. Transindividuation produces a picture of distinct agencies implicated in shared mediation through hormonal distribution and disruption. "Transindividuation" is what Haraway calls to when she says "our bodies ourselves."


## Szczygielska, Marianna. “Hyenas and Hormones: transpecies encounters and the traffic in humanimals,” Angelaki, Vol. 22, No. 2, 2017, pp. 61-84.

*"To resolve this ambiguity and defuse the imbalance created between the sameness and difference principles clashing in bio medical discourses, scientists
utilize sex hormones as mobile and versatile explanatory tools for the troubling case of the female 'phallus.'"* (p. 64).

- Minding that "sex hormones" is already essentialist. Many of these targeted steroid hormones also do much more in the body than determine or perturb sexual behavior, traits, and function. The creation of the "natural abnormality" (p. 73) is a product of science boundedness to producing natureculture. 

*"...human–hyena interspecies merging becomes a tool for translating bio logical states into cultural-societal meanings through medical discourses and scientific methods"* (p. 69-70).

- This is what "mechanical aid" does! It does not just a measure of the qualitative phenotype to the quantitative concentration of hormones, but moves back to the qualitative in cultural values. Qual/quant measurements transverse."*

*"Hyena bodies are not used for androgen production they are experimental bodies for producing scientific knowledge about sexual differentiation and this way are integral for trans and intersex being"* (p. 73).

- Note, Hyena bodies don't produce androgens that are used for pharmaceutical development, but they are still bodies on the eye of scientific scrutiny and under the fist of "natural"  binary gender production and reproduction, but if this narrative changes/when it is employed through trans/intersex ontoepistemologies, it is "integral" for being trans and intersex.

*"Until its closure in 2014, this scientific establishment [UCB] had been leading in laboratory research on spotted hyenas and specialized in endocrinological studies on hormone-based explanatory models of social behavior"* (p. 65).

- Affect scientifically explained away through hormones. Szczygielska calls the scientific willfillness that has led both the scientific community and the general population that steroid-sex hormones, and these hormones alone, determine behaviour in animals a "leap of faith" (p. 65)

*"For example, [Laurence G. Frank's] article “Evolution of Genital Masculinization: Why Do Female Hyaenas Have Such a Large ‘Penis’?” opens with a startling question: “Why would evolution create a reproductive organ so hazardous that 9–18% of females die during their first birth, and those that survive lose over 60% of their firstborn young?” (58). Not only does it put a strong focus on “extraordinary” genitalia but it also frames the analysis according to the reproductive costs and benefits evolutionary game"* (p. 66)

*"Interestingly, when it came to females the scientists concluded that “exposure to anti-androgens in utero enhanced ‘feminine’ characteristics of the clitoris” (ibid.), meaning that these cubs were born with a smaller clitoris. **Thus, for females, enhancing femaleness equals reducing the phallus**"* (p.  71).

- This science frames masculinization of feminine genitals as hazardous for reproductive health and species survival. The politics of purity transcend into the body as "natural abnormalities" aren't "natural" enough for science.

- The female phallus/clitoris being a uniquely female trait of the female hyena -- reducing it is only increasing femininity in the human eye.

*"The 'savior approach' is evident of colonial longings that significantly mark this perspective as embedded in the Western scientific project of recuperating hyenas’ reputation"* (p. 68).

*"Given that the hyena’s route in the traffic in animals runs through colonial and racialized imaginaries of Africa and its wildlife produced by the Western savior-science discourses, identification or affinity with this particularly racialized animal is already a site of privilege easily occupied by white bodies"* (p. 76).

- Gowdy uses her privileged narrative as a "saviour" approach to elephant life and reproduction, in part, through the use of vital endocrinology.

*"Nelly Oudshoorn highlights the split between biological and biochemical perspectives in sex endocrinology, with the first one conceptualizing hormones 'as sexually specific agents, controlling sexual characteristics,' and the latter framing them 'as catalysts: chemical substances, sexually unspecified in origin and function, exerting manifold activities in the organism, instead of being primarily sex agents'"* (p. 69).

- The biological [sex] hormone tells a different story than the biochemical hormone for Oudshoorn. I'm more interested in the biochemical hormone and its networks.

 
## Haraway, Donna. “Awash in Urine: DES and Premarin® in Multispecies Response-ability,” WSQ, Vol. 40, No. 1&2, 2012, pp. 301-316.

*"Still, my vet herself is too young to have been infected with my kind of terror of DES"* (p. 303).

*"To say this scene is emblematic of the mixed structures and affects of biomedical technoscience is an understatement"* (p. 305).

- Hormones are affective. Synthetic hormones like DES produce terror because of their history of medical harm, reproductive political control, and eugenics. However, we can compare this terror to pleasure in Preciado, and pleasure, terror, and mourning in Gowdy's *The White Bone*. Hormones produce affect beyond "being hormonal."

- Structures of affect in biochemistry/biotechnology transcend boundaries within ecologies.

*"Despite the fact the a double-blind study done at the University of Chicago in the early 1950s showed no benefit from DES for sustaining pregnancies in women, and the fact that by the late 1960s, six of seven leading human gynecological textbooks stated that DES did not prevent miscarriages..."* (p. 303).

- See Hayward and Ah-King who explore concern over different hormonal treatment in men v. women. Politics of purity and essentialist "female" hormones are a concern when reproducibility is in question.

*"MVD is the reason we changed prescriptions from a drug she had gobbled happily for a few years, called Propolin® (PPA, or phenylpropanolamine, “for oral use in dogs only”) to DES. PPA does a fine job pumping up urethral smooth muscle and keeping urine in its hygienic reservoirs for properly timed release in assigned places"* (p. 305).

- Much of this article traces endocrinology through multispecies urine. This is particularly important when tracing back to dogs like Cayenne. The world of dog (an other nonhuman animals) urine externalized is an entirely complex system of informatics that human animals are not privy to. Gowdy tries to portray this.

*"Or to find that “our bodies ourselves” includes mares and their foals (and a few stallions), with all the political and ethical consequences of that conjugation?"* (p. 307)

- I reject "our bodies ourselves," even if Haraway is using this phrase to connect it to the bodies and politics subsumed within "our bodies ourselves." Our bodies include other bodies. Other bodies/ecologies include our bodies.

*"However, reduced in volume, harvesting of pregnant mare urine (PMU) remains a worldwide business and Premarin® remains a much prescribed and profitable product"* (p. 309)

- What is the difference between these mares and the campesinos in Mexico looking for barbasco? Not a rhetorical question. Reproductive labour exploited to allow white, "Western" women more reproductive empowerment.

*"Having eaten Premarin® makes me more accountable to the well-being of ranchers, northern prairie ecologies, horses, activists, scientists, and women with breast cancer than I would otherwise be. Giving my dog DES makes me accountable to histories and ongoing possibilities differently from if we never shaped kinships with the attachment sites of this molecule"* (p. 313).

- Respnse-ability is when implication turns to accountability through networked relations.

## Hendron, Sara, What Can a Body Do? How we Meet the Built World. Penguin Random House, 2020.

*"'Neither the naked hand nor the understanding left to itself can effect much. It is by instruments and helps that work is done, which are as much wanted for the understanding as the hand'"* (Bacon qtd. in Hendron, p. 30)

*"Mike's prostheses tell a story that isn't primarily about machines; they are evidence of an endlessly plastic and adaptive human body--a human* person *...That's why the term* assistive technology *is easy shorthand but ultimately both redundant and misleading--because assistance is universaly whenever we talk about tools. The way the body and machine work together is much more aptly expressed by another name for prosthetics:* adaptive *technology"* (p. 40).

- Hendron quotes Bacon's *Novum Organum*, the text from which Mira takes its starting premise about mechanical aid. We are working through and with mechanical aid and instruments to navigate our embodied relations to the world. We mediate and are mediated. Disablied people with assistive and adaptive technologies know this well. Almost all bodies [at least that I'm looking at], not just human, are vital and adaptive.

*"But bodies are* produced *, in part, by the material world around them. Prosthetics are political, as surely they are biological"* (p. 58).

- What counts as a prosthesis? See Preciado's "Your Death" and use of the strap on dildo. Are pharmaceutical steroids prosthetic hormones--constantly vascilating from externalization out of bodies and internalization into bodies?

## Soto Laveaga, Gabriela. “Uncommon Trajectories: Steroid Hormones, Mexican Peasants, and the Search for a Wild Yam,” Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Vol. 36, No. 4, 2005, pp. 743–760.

*"‘The collection, selling and transport of urine, the search for remains from slaughterhouses and the ordering of a whale were all aimed at the same goal: the pro
duction of sex hormones. The making of sex hormones into material realities required the availability of tons of ovaries and testes, as well as millions of litersof urine’"* (Oudshoorn qtd, in Soto Laveaga, p. 743)

- Think through Cindy Baker's "Trucker Bombs" and labour https://www.gallerieswest.ca/magazine/stories/fat-activism/. The BPA-containing bottles

*"...in 1975 it was Mexican peasants who claimed that they and not foreign scientists were the ones who controlled the production of hormones, or rather, the raw material needed to produce synthetic hormones."* (p. 744)

*"Initially, without direct access to starting material, the pharmaceutical industry contracted exclusively with slaughterhouses for the purchase of gonads.*" (p. 745)

- Tissue Economies --> bioproducts are externalized outside the body and outside the body tissue, ownership of means of production and questions of intellectual potential to "innovate" change. Plants substitute animal sources of hormones (non lente hormones). Hormones in/as multispecies ecologies.

*"By disputing the role of pharmaceutical laboratories, Mexican campesinos (peasants) challenged the way in which history is told, disseminated, and ultimately written. They brought to the fore the following question: what happens when knowledge which is contained within laboratories suddenly makes its way outside the laboratory walls and filters into the most unexpected of spaces?"* (p. 745)

- Read with *Tissue Economies* (Waldby and Mitchell) and Lateral Agency (Berlant) - not just agency inside bodies (though labour in farming and ag is embodied, no doubt) but also in spaces, ecologies, as bodies.

*"Once having obtained large quantities of root, Marker then synthesized more progesterone than had ever been synthesized before, 2000 grams—at the time worth nearly $160,000 dollars."* (p. 749)

*"Interestingly, though barbasco grew in abundance in southern Mexico, it had no commercial value...Locally, barbasco was well known as a fish poison, but it was also considered a pesky ‘weed’ that invaded corn fields"* (p. 753)

- **Barbasco had a non-fungible in exchange value between its local context and the pharmaceutical industry, but the labourers employed (near-enslaved) to find and chop the root were fungible resources. It also inhabited both ends of the pharmakon's politics of purity; a means to the absolute essence of progesterone, and a toxic substance threatenting local water ecosystems.**

*"Once they had found, extracted, and chopped the barbasco root, they would shift the child and sling him across their breast and carry the bundle of fresh barbasco on their backs. Having balanced their human and barbasco bundles, women would begin the walk to the nearest collection center."* (p. 754)

- Reproductive labour meeting labour for economic gain - both embodied and physically demanding in plantation relations. Network of reproductive politics on the field, mothers with infants across breasts picking barbasco so that white women could have access to birth control.

## *Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things*, Jane Bennett. 2010.

*"How would political responses to public problems change were we to take seriously the vitality of (nonhuman) bodies? By 'vitality' I mean the capacity of things--edibles, commodities, storms, metals--not only to impede or block the trajectories, propensities, or tendicies of their own...What difference would it make to public health if eating was understood as an encounter between various and variegated bodies, **some of them mine, most of them not, and none of which always gets the upper hand...to be figured not simply as a resource, commoditiy, or instrumentality, but also and more radically as an 'actant'?"** (p. viii)* 

*"For Spinoza, both simple bodies (which are perhaps better termed *protobodies*) and the complex or mosaicized modes they form are conative. In the case of the former, conatus is expressed as a stubborness or inertial tendency to persists in the case of a complex body or mode, conatus refers to the effort required to maintain the specific relation of **'movement and rest'** that obtains between its parts, a relation that defines the mode as what it is...What it means to be a "mode," then is to form alliances and enter assemblages: it is to mod(e)ify and be modified by others. The process of modification is not under the control of any one mode--no mode is an agent in the hierarchical sense." (p. 22)*

*"'The bacteria in the human microbiome collectively possess at least 100 times as many genes as the mere 20,000 or so in the human genome.' The *its* outnumber the *mes*. In a world of vibrant matter, it is thus not enough to say that we are 'embodied.' We are, rather, an *array of bodies*, many different kinds of them in a nested set of microbiomes." (pp. 112-113)*

- Vital materialism successfully moves away from posthumanism's autopoeitic-inspired systems theory and offers instead networks of sympoeisis (where systems indicate (often human) intentionality rather than distributed agency (see notes below). The autopoeitic tendencies of posthuman mutliplicities are centered around the (post)human subject and are in favour the agency of (post)human subjectivity (p. 120). These are the hurdles of theorizing human and nonhuman networks which vital materialists aim to surpass.

- Spinoza's conatus acts similarly to homeostatic modes for maintaining feedback (presence/absence, pattern/randomness, movement/rest) that is often found in cybernetic theories and of Hayles' "distributed consciousness." However, Bennett's use of Spinoza here departs from the cybernetic tradition of posthumanism as it assumes no heirarchy of status or intent, perhaps even no purpose in action, simply and assemblage of actants. Adopting such as view of distributed agency, as Bennett ultimately argues, reimagines relations between human and nonhuman not as relations of control and maintainance as in the tradition of cybernetics (and through poststructuralism such as Foucauldian thought), but instead necessitates a responsibility within and across assemblages (p. 37).

- Further, theories of embodiment are ontologically unsatisfactory for Bennett as they also fail to surpass the hurdle of human subjectivity; despite aiming to overcome a mind/body dualism that limits the locus of human subjectivity to the immaterial and transcendental mind, embodiment theories even in their figurations of multiplicities, such as "fragmented identities," still imagine a central locus to which those identities belong. 

*"...a strong distinction between persons and things must remain lest one have no *moral* grounds for privileging man over germ...First, by acknowledging that the framework of subject versus object had indeed at times worked to prevent or ameliorate human suffering and to promote human happieness or well-being. Second,by noting that its successes come at the price of an instrumentalization of nonhuman nature that can itself be unethical and can itself undermine long-term human interests. Third, by pointing out that the Kantian imperative to treat humanity always as an end-in-itself and never merely as a means does not have a stellar record of success in preventing human suffering or promoting human well-being." (p. 12)*

- Again, we see that the relationship between affect, ethics, and politics is inseperable, despite attempts in Gregg and Seigworth (introduction) to isolate these objects. The assemblages of vital materialism point to the necessity of accounting for the aesthetic in the ethical and the political in the affectual and so on. That being said, Bennett's chapter on food, while discussing ethics of obesity and diet, starkly omits politics of food security and food soveriegnty and vital materialisms of consumerism, capitalism, and environmental ecologies which create excess for some and absence for others (p. 51).

*"...it may be relevant to note the extent to which **intentional reflexivity** is also a product of the interplay of human and nonhuman forces. Bernard Stiegler does just this in his study of how tool-use engendered a being with an inside, with, that is, a psychological landscape of interiority. Stiegler contends that conscious reflection in (proto)humans first emerged with the use of stone tools because the materiality of the tool acted as an external marker of a past need, as an 'archive' of its function. The stone tool (its texture, color, weight), in calling attention to its projected and recollected use, produced the first hollow of reflection. Humanity and nonhumanity have always performed an intricate dance with each other. There was never a time when human agency was anything other than an interfolding network of humanity and nonhumanity; today this mingling has become harder to ignore." (p. 31)*

- Steigler's notions of co-construction between human and tool (a chicken-and-egg scenario of human consciousness and thing-as-tool) must concede the agency of the nonhuman in this co-productive relationship. However, if a thing of vital materiality has agency (as vital materialists argue they do), it cannot be a "mediating" object and "tools" as used in Stiegler's example cannot exist--at least, not as we imagine them to. That is, to be understood as a "tool," the thing must take on a mediating relation between at least two other things or events (an octopus uses a shell to hide, a human uses a hammer to drive a nail). This mediating role that we so often imagine tools to take on reduces the thing's agency, assuming intentionality in the *user* but not in the *object of use.* This conception of tool is antithetical to vital materialism: a hammer or a shell cannot be tools. Instead, these shimmering and lively things are actants in assemblages without any passive vassalage to "a user."

- Note, Bennett does not explicitly shun the "tool" from vital materialism as I have; she includes "actant" and "tool" equally in a long list of descriptors that she uses to describe food (p. 39).

## Ah-King, Malin and Eva Hayward. "Toxic Sexes: Perverting Pollution and Queering Hormone Reception" *O-Zone: A Journal of Object-Oriented Studies*, Issue 1: Object/Ecology, 2013, pp. 1-12.

*"“Toxic sex” foregrounds sex as an ongoing process influenced by endocrine disruptive chemicals, describing our shared vulnerability to one another; our bodies are open to the planet....this essay: 1) traces some popular discourses about the effects of endocrine disruption through the normative assumptions of sex and sexuality; 2) suggests a broadened understanding of pollution-induced sexual change through a dynamic model of “reactive sex” (Ah-King & Nylin 2010); and, 3) proffers an approach toward an ecological resilience that reframes the toxicity without reasserting a politics of purity"* (p. 2)

- Boundary building, distribution and redistribution are ongoing processes in hormonal networks. As such, an essentialist "politics of purity" is an inaccurate representation of the effects of hormones, primarily driven by moral scientism. Harawayan response-ability is next step after identifying disruptive and (unequally) distributed effects the political economies in chemical regimes of living.

- Pop hormones offer a scientistic discourse to reinforce hetero- and cis-normative essentialism as "natural." This is part of the discourse driven by a "politics of purity."

*"Sewage works are not built to filter used water from drugs and other endocrine disruptors (Naturvårdsverket 2008, Steingraber 2010). Consequently, these substances pass through water systems and end up back in our environments (Steingraber 2010)."* (p. 3)

*"Reports notify of banana plantation workers that become sterile, have increased cancer risk, or die from poisoning (Thrupp 1991; Henriques et al. 1997)."* (p. 3)

- Ecologies changing faster than built environments and the effects of disruption and distribution are disporportionately effecting bodies in a matrix of vulnerability and precarity; that is impoverished, disenfranchised, gender non-conforming, disabled, Black, Indigenous, and Brown bodies.

*"These calls for response reveal a central importance given to “male” bodies, and a lack of concern for women’s health problems. What is unveiled here is a preoccupation with vulnerability of masculinity, maleness, and manhood, those precious commodities of any patriarchal system."* (p. 5)

- This is not always true. Women's health is a concern when the ability of a women to undergo reproductive labour is threatened. Consider how pollution acts as chemical sterilization for Black, Indigenous, and Brown bodies so that white supremacy in the medical system no longer has to get its hands dirty. Canada's recent history with forced sterilization. See Mira, Murphy (chemical exposure in utero)

*"Instead of thinking of sex as a nature-given dichotomy, or essentially discrete characteristic, sex is better understood as a responsive potential, changing over an individual's lifetime, in interaction with environmental factors, as well as over evolutionary time...Genes for sexual characteristics are carried by both sexes, regulated by hormones, and, therefore, characteristics of both sexes are within the “potential” of most individuals; that is to say that sex changing, intersexuality and expressing characteristics of both sexes is, for many organisms, part of their species potential"* (p. 6).

- Ah-King and Hayward see sexual/steroid hormones' role in recomposing, remediating, and collapsing boundaries of dichotomy in sex itself. They see embodied relations as potential, not determined traits.
