## Hendron, Sara, What Can a Body Do? How we Meet the Built World. Penguin Random House, 2020.

*"'Neither the naked hand nor the understanding left to itself can effect much. It is by instruments and helps that work is done, which are as much wanted for the understanding as the hand'"* (Bacon qtd. in Hendron, p. 30)

*"Mike's prostheses tell a story that isn't primarily about machines; they are evidence of an endlessly plastic and adaptive human body--a human* person *...That's why the term* assistive technology *is easy shorthand but ultimately both redundant and misleading--because assistance is universaly whenever we talk about tools. The way the body and machine work together is much more aptly expressed by another name for prosthetics:* adaptive *technology"* (p. 40).

- Hendron quotes Bacon's *Novum Organum*, the text from which Mira takes its starting premise about mechanical aid. We are working through and with mechanical aid and instruments to navigate our embodied relations to the world. We mediate and are mediated. Disablied people with assistive and adaptive technologies know this well. Almost all bodies [at least that I'm looking at], not just human, are vital and adaptive.

*"But bodies are* produced *, in part, by the material world around them. Prosthetics are political, as surely they are biological"* (p. 58).

- What counts as a prosthesis? See Preciado's "Your Death" and use of the strap on dildo. Are pharmaceutical steroids prosthetic hormones--constantly vascilating from externalization out of bodies and internalization into bodies?

## Soto Laveaga, Gabriela. “Uncommon Trajectories: Steroid Hormones, Mexican Peasants, and the Search for a Wild Yam,” Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Vol. 36, No. 4, 2005, pp. 743–760.

*"‘The collection, selling and transport of urine, the search for remains from slaughterhouses and the ordering of a whale were all aimed at the same goal: the pro
duction of sex hormones. The making of sex hormones into material realities required the availability of tons of ovaries and testes, as well as millions of litersof urine’"* (Oudshoorn qtd, in Soto Laveaga, p. 743)

- Think through Cindy Baker's "Trucker Bombs" and labour https://www.gallerieswest.ca/magazine/stories/fat-activism/. The BPA-containing bottles

*"...in 1975 it was Mexican peasants who claimed that they and not foreign scientists were the ones who controlled the production of hormones, or rather, the raw material needed to produce synthetic hormones."* (p. 744)

*"Initially, without direct access to starting material, the pharmaceutical industry contracted exclusively with slaughterhouses for the purchase of gonads.*" (p. 745)

- Tissue Economies --> bioproducts are externalized outside the body and outside the body tissue, ownership of means of production and questions of intellectual potential to "innovate" change. Plants substitute animal sources of hormones (non lente hormones). Hormones in/as multispecies ecologies.

*"By disputing the role of pharmaceutical laboratories, Mexican campesinos (peasants) challenged the way in which history is told, disseminated, and ultimately written. They brought to the fore the following question: what happens when knowledge which is contained within laboratories suddenly makes its way outside the laboratory walls and filters into the most unexpected of spaces?"* (p. 745)

- Read with *Tissue Economies* (Waldby and Mitchell) and Lateral Agency (Berlant) - not just agency inside bodies (though labour in farming and ag is embodied, no doubt) but also in spaces, ecologies, as bodies.

*"Once having obtained large quantities of root, Marker then synthesized more progesterone than had ever been synthesized before, 2000 grams—at the time worth nearly $160,000 dollars."* (p. 749)

*"Interestingly, though barbasco grew in abundance in southern Mexico, it had no commercial value...Locally, barbasco was well known as a fish poison, but it was also considered a pesky ‘weed’ that invaded corn fields"* (p. 753)

- **Barbasco had a non-fungible in exchange value between its local context and the pharmaceutical industry, but the labourers employed (near-enslaved) to find and chop the root were fungible resources. It also inhabited both ends of the pharmakon's politics of purity; a means to the absolute essence of progesterone, and a toxic substance threatenting local water ecosystems.**

*"Once they had found, extracted, and chopped the barbasco root, they would shift the child and sling him across their breast and carry the bundle of fresh barbasco on their backs. Having balanced their human and barbasco bundles, women would begin the walk to the nearest collection center."* (p. 754)

- Reproductive labour meeting labour for economic gain - both embodied and physically demanding in plantation relations. Network of reproductive politics on the field, mothers with infants across breasts picking barbasco so that white women could have access to birth control.

## *Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things*, Jane Bennett. 2010.

*"How would political responses to public problems change were we to take seriously the vitality of (nonhuman) bodies? By 'vitality' I mean the capacity of things--edibles, commodities, storms, metals--not only to impede or block the trajectories, propensities, or tendicies of their own...What difference would it make to public health if eating was understood as an encounter between various and variegated bodies, **some of them mine, most of them not, and none of which always gets the upper hand...to be figured not simply as a resource, commoditiy, or instrumentality, but also and more radically as an 'actant'?"** (p. viii)* 

*"For Spinoza, both simple bodies (which are perhaps better termed *protobodies*) and the complex or mosaicized modes they form are conative. In the case of the former, conatus is expressed as a stubborness or inertial tendency to persists in the case of a complex body or mode, conatus refers to the effort required to maintain the specific relation of **'movement and rest'** that obtains between its parts, a relation that defines the mode as what it is...What it means to be a "mode," then is to form alliances and enter assemblages: it is to mod(e)ify and be modified by others. The process of modification is not under the control of any one mode--no mode is an agent in the hierarchical sense." (p. 22)*

*"'The bacteria in the human microbiome collectively possess at least 100 times as many genes as the mere 20,000 or so in the human genome.' The *its* outnumber the *mes*. In a world of vibrant matter, it is thus not enough to say that we are 'embodied.' We are, rather, an *array of bodies*, many different kinds of them in a nested set of microbiomes." (pp. 112-113)*

- Vital materialism successfully moves away from posthumanism's autopoeitic-inspired systems theory and offers instead networks of sympoeisis (where systems indicate (often human) intentionality rather than distributed agency (see notes below). The autopoeitic tendencies of posthuman mutliplicities are centered around the (post)human subject and are in favour the agency of (post)human subjectivity (p. 120). These are the hurdles of theorizing human and nonhuman networks which vital materialists aim to surpass.

- Spinoza's conatus acts similarly to homeostatic modes for maintaining feedback (presence/absence, pattern/randomness, movement/rest) that is often found in cybernetic theories and of Hayles' "distributed consciousness." However, Bennett's use of Spinoza here departs from the cybernetic tradition of posthumanism as it assumes no heirarchy of status or intent, perhaps even no purpose in action, simply and assemblage of actants. Adopting such as view of distributed agency, as Bennett ultimately argues, reimagines relations between human and nonhuman not as relations of control and maintainance as in the tradition of cybernetics (and through poststructuralism such as Foucauldian thought), but instead necessitates a responsibility within and across assemblages (p. 37).

- Further, theories of embodiment are ontologically unsatisfactory for Bennett as they also fail to surpass the hurdle of human subjectivity; despite aiming to overcome a mind/body dualism that limits the locus of human subjectivity to the immaterial and transcendental mind, embodiment theories even in their figurations of multiplicities, such as "fragmented identities," still imagine a central locus to which those identities belong. 

*"...a strong distinction between persons and things must remain lest one have no *moral* grounds for privileging man over germ...First, by acknowledging that the framework of subject versus object had indeed at times worked to prevent or ameliorate human suffering and to promote human happieness or well-being. Second,by noting that its successes come at the price of an instrumentalization of nonhuman nature that can itself be unethical and can itself undermine long-term human interests. Third, by pointing out that the Kantian imperative to treat humanity always as an end-in-itself and never merely as a means does not have a stellar record of success in preventing human suffering or promoting human well-being." (p. 12)*

- Again, we see that the relationship between affect, ethics, and politics is inseperable, despite attempts in Gregg and Seigworth (introduction) to isolate these objects. The assemblages of vital materialism point to the necessity of accounting for the aesthetic in the ethical and the political in the affectual and so on. That being said, Bennett's chapter on food, while discussing ethics of obesity and diet, starkly omits politics of food security and food soveriegnty and vital materialisms of consumerism, capitalism, and environmental ecologies which create excess for some and absence for others (p. 51).

*"...it may be relevant to note the extent to which **intentional reflexivity** is also a product of the interplay of human and nonhuman forces. Bernard Stiegler does just this in his study of how tool-use engendered a being with an inside, with, that is, a psychological landscape of interiority. Stiegler contends that conscious reflection in (proto)humans first emerged with the use of stone tools because the materiality of the tool acted as an external marker of a past need, as an 'archive' of its function. The stone tool (its texture, color, weight), in calling attention to its projected and recollected use, produced the first hollow of reflection. Humanity and nonhumanity have always performed an intricate dance with each other. There was never a time when human agency was anything other than an interfolding network of humanity and nonhumanity; today this mingling has become harder to ignore." (p. 31)*

- Steigler's notions of co-construction between human and tool (a chicken-and-egg scenario of human consciousness and thing-as-tool) must concede the agency of the nonhuman in this co-productive relationship. However, if a thing of vital materiality has agency (as vital materialists argue they do), it cannot be a "mediating" object and "tools" as used in Stiegler's example cannot exist--at least, not as we imagine them to. That is, to be understood as a "tool," the thing must take on a mediating relation between at least two other things or events (an octopus uses a shell to hide, a human uses a hammer to drive a nail). This mediating role that we so often imagine tools to take on reduces the thing's agency, assuming intentionality in the *user* but not in the *object of use.* This conception of tool is antithetical to vital materialism: a hammer or a shell cannot be tools. Instead, these shimmering and lively things are actants in assemblages without any passive vassalage to "a user."

- Note, Bennett does not explicitly shun the "tool" from vital materialism as I have; she includes "actant" and "tool" equally in a long list of descriptors that she uses to describe food (p. 39).

## Ah-King, Malin and Eva Hayward. "Toxic Sexes: Perverting Pollution and Queering Hormone Reception" *O-Zone: A Journal of Object-Oriented Studies*, Issue 1: Object/Ecology, 2013, pp. 1-12.

*"“Toxic sex” foregrounds sex as an ongoing process influenced by endocrine disruptive chemicals, describing our shared vulnerability to one another; our bodies are open to the planet....this essay: 1) traces some popular discourses about the effects of endocrine disruption through the normative assumptions of sex and sexuality; 2) suggests a broadened understanding of pollution-induced sexual change through a dynamic model of “reactive sex” (Ah-King & Nylin 2010); and, 3) proffers an approach toward an ecological resilience that reframes the toxicity without reasserting a politics of purity"* (p. 2)

- Boundary building, distribution and redistribution are ongoing processes in hormonal networks. As such, an essentialist "politics of purity" is an inaccurate representation of the effects of hormones, primarily driven by moral scientism. Harawayan response-ability is next step after identifying disruptive and (unequally) distributed effects the political economies in chemical regimes of living.

- Pop hormones offer a scientistic discourse to reinforce hetero- and cis-normative essentialism as "natural." This is part of the discourse driven by a "politics of purity."

*"Sewage works are not built to filter used water from drugs and other endocrine disruptors (Naturvårdsverket 2008, Steingraber 2010). Consequently, these substances pass through water systems and end up back in our environments (Steingraber 2010)."* (p. 3)

*"Reports notify of banana plantation workers that become sterile, have increased cancer risk, or die from poisoning (Thrupp 1991; Henriques et al. 1997)."* (p. 3)

- Ecologies changing faster than built environments and the effects of disruption and distribution are disporportionately effecting bodies in a matrix of vulnerability and precarity; that is impoverished, disenfranchised, gender non-conforming, disabled, Black, Indigenous, and Brown bodies.

*"These calls for response reveal a central importance given to “male” bodies, and a lack of concern for women’s health problems. What is unveiled here is a preoccupation with vulnerability of masculinity, maleness, and manhood, those precious commodities of any patriarchal system."* (p. 5)

- This is not always true. Women's health is a concern when the ability of a women to undergo reproductive labour is threatened. Consider how pollution acts as chemical sterilization for Black, Indigenous, and Brown bodies so that white supremacy in the medical system no longer has to get its hands dirty. Canada's recent history with forced sterilization. See Mira, Murphy (chemical exposure in utero)

*"Instead of thinking of sex as a nature-given dichotomy, or essentially discrete characteristic, sex is better understood as a responsive potential, changing over an individual's lifetime, in interaction with environmental factors, as well as over evolutionary time...Genes for sexual characteristics are carried by both sexes, regulated by hormones, and, therefore, characteristics of both sexes are within the “potential” of most individuals; that is to say that sex changing, intersexuality and expressing characteristics of both sexes is, for many organisms, part of their species potential"* (p. 6).

- Ah-King and Hayward see sexual/steroid hormones' role in recomposing, remediating, and collapsing boundaries of dichotomy in sex itself. They see embodied relations as potential, not determined traits.
