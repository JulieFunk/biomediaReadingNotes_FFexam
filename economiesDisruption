## Waldby, Catherine and Robert Mitchell. *Tissue Economies: Blood, Organs, and Cell Lines in Late Capitalism*, 2006.

*"Previous commentators have noted, but only in a cursory way, that the majority in the state supreme court discussed at some length the similarities between Moore's cells and human feces...This discourse focused on* valuable *human tissues, such as blood and organs, and linked the dissemination of these tissues to the smooth flow of information between management facilities (for example, hospitals and blood blanks); the absence of such information flows was purported to produce tissue waste in the form of expired blood and degraded organs"* (p. 90).

- In Moore's case, California's supreme court found that individuals held no property rights to the excised diseased tissue (i.e., "waste") used to create and commercialize infinite cell lines. However, this grants intellectual rights and property rights only to those who *have the ability* to turn "waste" tissue into something with use value and thereby, under neoliberal organization of medical systems, exchange value (commodity). The court's findings did not account for the labour of the patient in their production and housing of the tissues before surgical excision. I suggest that these patients are co-producers of these scientific findings and should be granted co-authorship on medical patents and papers. 

- I extend this concern to tissues taken from plants and animals. Here, the courts' judgements on "dignity" are no longer useful (see Wolfe). The question of dignity does not sufficiently get at the issue of labour. Instead, questions of sovereignty and sustainablity should inform tissue collection of all living organisms where "sovereignty" recognizes the organism's vitality and its role as labourer and co-producer. When collections transformations of living tissue are informed by the sovereignty of the organism from which the tissue was originally  produced, "dignity" should be a foregone conclusion.

*"In that case [police seizure of feces] the Maryland Court of Appeals had concluded that just as people often assert 'ownership, dominion, or control' over body parts such as 'hair, fingernails, toenails, blood and organs,' so too ought one be able to exert these powers over 'excrememnt, fluid waste, [and] secretions...The court noted that human waste such as feces lacked the 'dignity of the human cell'"* (p. 93)
